/// Analytic two-bone IK (shoulder, elbow, wrist), the same steps as Drawn Together's SolveTwoBoneIK:
///   1. clamp the reach between |L1 - L2| and L1 + L2,
///   2. the law of cosines gives the angle at the shoulder,
///   3. the pole (a point the elbow should bend toward), made perpendicular to the shoulder-to-target
///      line, picks which way the elbow goes around that line,
///   4. rotate the upper arm to the elbow, then the forearm to the target.
/// Bones are turned with world-space rotations, so it works on any rig whatever its bone axes.
/// Call it on a pose that starts from the bind pose each frame, or twist builds up.
